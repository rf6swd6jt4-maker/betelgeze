## Shared UI vocabulary

Before adding pills, badges, tags, assignee treatments, labels, statuses, chevron selectors, compact choice drawers, communication-method controls, panel-tab headers, quick statistics, filters, lists, or detail pages, read `docs/ui-standards.md`. Use the primitives exported by `components/ui`, `components/panel`, `components/list`, and `components/detail`; do not invent page-local variants when a shared primitive covers the meaning. A collection of comparable records must be checked against the documented `List` definition before it receives a custom repeated-row layout. A record route must be checked against the documented detail-page definition before it receives a custom header, fields block, or danger zone. If the design language changes, update the primitive, existing uses, and the standards document together so the change propagates consistently.
