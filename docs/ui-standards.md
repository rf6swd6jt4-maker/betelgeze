# Betelgeze UI standards

Repeated interface elements use the primitives exported from `components/ui`, `components/panel`, `components/list`, and `components/detail`. New UI must not recreate them with page-local Tailwind classes.

## Workspace shell layers

Keep the shell stacking order explicit: tab content `30`, relationship context `35`, tab bar `40`, mobile sidebar dismiss surface `45`, sidebar `50`, top bar and its dropdowns `55`, notices `60`, and dialogs `90` or higher. The top bar creates a stacking context, so increasing a dropdown's own z-index cannot lift it above a sibling sidebar. Keep the entire top bar above the sidebar so account and desktop/mobile search popups stay visible and clickable. Use `AnchoredPopup` for editors that must escape an iframe or clipping ancestor; loading overlays remain above all interactive surfaces.

Top-bar mutation feedback uses short, bounded labels (`Saving…`, `Saved`, `Action failed`). Full error details stay in the originating form and the status tooltip/accessibility label; they must never expand the header or displace search, navigation, presence, or account controls.

## Popup motion

Every custom popup uses the shared opening motion on both mobile and desktop. Apply `betelgeze-popup-enter` to the visible menu, tooltip, field editor, or dialog surface: a `140ms ease-out` opacity fade with `4px` of upward travel into its final position. `AnchoredPopup` applies this automatically once its initial position is measured; do not animate its children a second time.

- Animate the dialog card, not its full-screen backdrop. Backdrops appear immediately and remain stationary.
- Use `betelgeze-popup-fade` for full-screen previews, lightboxes, and viewport-filling client panels where movement would expose an edge or disturb fixed descendants.
- Closing is immediate. Do not delay dismissal, navigation, focus restoration, or input behind an exit animation.
- Opening motion runs once when the surface appears, not when its contents load, resize, scroll, or update. Do not key an entire popup by changing form values or search results.
- Both shared classes disable animation for `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Keep motion limited to opacity and transform. Do not animate dimensions, layout coordinates, blur, or shadow; do not add animation libraries, JavaScript frame loops, persistent `will-change`, or retained animation transforms.
- Preserve portal ownership, viewport clamping, stacking levels, focus behaviour, and outside-click/Escape dismissal. Existing sliding navigation panels and loading indicators retain their separate behaviour; browser-native selects and confirmation prompts remain browser-controlled.

## Message action gestures

Message bubbles use `NativeMessageBubble` for action activation in client chats, team/direct chats, and the client portal. Desktop opens the action popup on right-click; touch opens it after a stationary `450ms` hold. A normal click or tap does not open message actions. Movement beyond `10px`, multiple touches, touch cancellation, release before the threshold, or unmount cancels a pending hold. A completed hold must not also trigger a reply/delete swipe or a synthetic click.

Preserve embedded links, buttons, audio/video controls, and scrolling. Keyboard users can open actions with Enter, Space, the context-menu key, or Shift+F10 while the bubble is focused. Popups use the shared opening motion above.

## Chat message formatting

Client, team/direct, and portal message bodies use `ChatMessageText`. Supported inline syntax is `**bold**`, `__italic__`, and `~~strikethrough~~`; HTTP(S) links remain clickable and message HTML remains plain text. Message-content lists use semantic `ol`/`ul` elements, with `1. ` and `- ` markers and two-space nesting. These are authored message content, not record collections covered by `List`.

Composers share `chatListEdit` and the chat composer list handlers. Enter continues a list and increments numbered markers; Enter on an empty item removes the marker and exits the list. Tab/Shift+Tab indent/outdent a list line by two spaces. Shift+Enter inserts a plain newline, and Enter outside a list retains send behavior. The send button remains available while composing lists.

## Status

`Status` communicates operational state, health, or progress. Its appearance follows the lead-generation poll UI: a Betelgeze diamond followed by plain text.

Statuses have exactly four tones:

Use `surface="light"` on light client-facing surfaces such as onboarding. This keeps the same diamond and tone meanings with darker text and marks for readable contrast. The default remains the workspace's dark surface.

| Tone | Meaning | Typical examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grey` | Not started, inactive, unknown, or neutral | Initialising, queued, disabled |
| `yellow` | Active, waiting, or needs attention | In progress, pending, warning |
| `green` | Genuinely successful or ready | Successful, completed, verified |
| `red` | Failed, blocked, cancelled, or unavailable | Failed, error, blocked |

Do not add blue, violet, or other status colours. A configured, managed, or pending integration is not green unless the real path has been verified.

```tsx
<Status label="Initialising" tone="grey" />
<Status label="In progress" tone="yellow" />
<Status label="Successful" tone="green" />
<Status label="Failed" tone="red" />
```

In space-constrained visualisations such as Gantt bars, use `compact` to show only the canonical status mark. The component retains the status label for assistive technology and hover disclosure; do not recreate a local dot, circle, or icon treatment.

```tsx
<Status label="Overdue" tone="red" compact />
```

### StatusStat

`StatusStat` is the compact numerical sibling of `Status`. It uses the same four tone meanings and typography, but a bold tabular number takes the place of the Betelgeze diamond. Use it for small grouped state counts such as source-settings summaries; do not use a pill or a hand-built coloured count for this pattern.

```tsx
<StatusStat value={12} label="Enabled" tone="green" />
<StatusStat value={0} label="Disabled" tone="grey" />
<StatusStat value={8} label="Not mapped" tone="yellow" />
<StatusStat value={2} label="No config" tone="red" />
```

## RoundPill

`RoundPill` represents assigned or attached things: services, modules, people, categories, filters, or other compact metadata. Its aesthetic comes from the assigned service and module pills in onboarding detail.

Pill colours are fixed RGB values rather than translucent utilities, so they remain identical on every surface. The first two recipes are sampled directly from the approved RoundPills; the remaining recipes preserve the same dark face, chromatic edge, and pale text relationship:

| Tone | Border | Background | Text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `emerald` | `#014E38` | `#051C16` | `#A4F5CF` |
| `sky` | `#01426B` | `#051B29` | `#B6E4FC` |
| `yellow` | `#8A7D00` | `#2B2A08` | `#FFF3A3` |
| `amber` | `#6D2D00` | `#281206` | `#FEE685` |
| `red` | `#720810` | `#28090A` | `#FFC9C9` |
| `violet` | `#440D89` | `#1D0C39` | `#DDD6FF` |
| `neutral` | `#404040` | `#171717` | `#D4D4D4` |

These values are the palette definition. Do not substitute nearby framework colour tokens or recreate them with opacity.

`yellow` is the canonical tone for `Test` labels across the platform. It retains the same glassy, near-black chromatic face as the rest of the palette, but keeps its red and green channels close so it reads as yellow rather than amber or brown. `amber` is warmer and more orange; retain it for labels that need that distinction rather than using it as a substitute for `Test`.

Use `Assignee` when the attached thing is a person assigned to something. Its default is the canonical avatar-and-name form of `RoundPill`; do not assemble a separate profile-picture treatment for assignees. In space-constrained visualisations such as Gantt bars, use its `compact` avatar-only mode.

```tsx
<RoundPill tone="emerald">Paid Social</RoundPill>
<RoundPill tone="sky">Reporting</RoundPill>
<Assignee name="Alex Morgan" avatarSrc={avatarUrl} />
<Assignee name="Alex Morgan" avatarSrc={avatarUrl} compact />
<Assignee name="Alex Morgan" avatarSrc={avatarUrl} compact compactSize="md" />
```

## SquarePill

`SquarePill` is the boxier, rounded-corner label treatment. Use it for categorical labels such as `Stuck` or `Test`. It shares RoundPill's border, background, text, spacing, and colour palette; only its shape differs.

```tsx
<SquarePill tone="amber">Stuck</SquarePill>
<SquarePill tone="yellow">Test</SquarePill>
```

## RelationshipStage

`RelationshipStage` is reserved for relationship lifecycle stages. It reads its border, background, and text colours from the exact same `pillTones` definitions as `RoundPill`; it must never maintain a separate stage palette. It is otherwise identical in height, typography, border weight, and spacing. The only difference is its silhouette.

The silhouette is a rectangle with half of a Betelgeze diamond attached to each end. It is exactly 24px high. Each pointed end is 12px deep, so its upper and lower edges travel at 45 degrees and meet at the vertical midpoint. In polygon terms, the six outer points are: top-left after 12px, top-right before 12px, right midpoint, bottom-right before 12px, bottom-left after 12px, and left midpoint. Do not soften, round, shorten, or reinterpret these four diagonal edges.

Relationship stages are categorical labels, not operational statuses. Their stage-specific colours therefore do not expand or alter the four-colour `Status` meanings. Pass the lifecycle phase itself so the component owns both its canonical wording and colour.

The lifecycle palette assigns distinct tones to the active parent stages: Lead `sky`, Potential Client `amber`, Sold `emerald`, legacy Invoiced `yellow`, Onboarding `violet`, Onboarding Review `emerald`, Fulfilment `red`, and Retention `neutral`. These are categorical Gantt colours, not status meanings.

```tsx
<RelationshipStage phase="onboarding" />
<RelationshipStage phase="fulfilment" />
```

Do not use this shape for statuses, tests, warnings, services, modules, or arbitrary metadata.

## Shared rules

- Use sentence case; do not add uppercase tracking to ordinary pills or statuses.
- Pick pill colours by stable category. Status colours always retain the meanings above.
- Keep compact elements short. Put explanations in adjacent copy, a tooltip, or expanded detail.
- Extend a shared primitive when a new stable variant is required. Do not invent a one-off treatment in a page.
- When the design changes, update `components/ui`, this document, and existing uses together.
- A local exception must include a code comment explaining why the shared primitive cannot represent it.

## PanelTabHeader

`PanelTabHeader` is the canonical heading block for a workspace panel tab. It names the active tab and its primary content, not the wider panel that contains it.

```tsx
<PanelTabHeader
    title="Leads"
    description="Qualified owner-phone leads from the latest poll."
    actions={<NewPollButton />}
    tabs={<PanelTabs items={leadGenTabs} active="leads" ariaLabel="Lead Gen panel" />}
/>
```

- A panel home route uses the home tab or list name: `Work Queue`, never `Admin`; `Leads`, never `Lead Gen`.
- The description directly explains the active tab's content, ordering, or purpose. It must not summarize every capability in the parent panel. Begin with stable copy that identifies the list; a following sentence may adapt to the current list contents. Desktop descriptions occupy one visual line and truncate when necessary, so put the stable information first; mobile descriptions may wrap.
- When the panel contains multiple tabs, `PanelTabs` occupy a dedicated row immediately beneath the description and above `QuickStats`, filters, or tab content. They remain horizontally scrollable on mobile.
- The title-to-description gap is always `0.5rem` (`mt-2`). Do not reserve blank description lines or add a minimum height to the description slot.
- Optional primary actions occupy the header's right-hand action slot on desktop. The action row bottom-aligns with the actual bottom of the description line, not with an artificial header height.
- Put one principal action in this slot, such as `New Poll` or `Start new relationship`. Supplementary metadata may sit immediately before it, but the primary action remains the final, rightmost control.
- On mobile the action slot follows the description and uses the full available width without displacing the title or tab row.
- Do not place tab navigation beside the title, inside the action slot, below statistics, or in page-local wrappers with different spacing.
- A tab containing a list has exactly one page heading. Do not repeat the list name or add another explanatory list header between the panel tabs and the list.
- If a tab changes its principal content through a tab query such as Admin Work/OKRs, the heading and description change with the selected tab.

The standard vertical order is:

1. `PanelTabHeader`: title and description/action row, then `PanelTabs` when the panel has tabs.
2. `QuickStats` or another approved analytical summary.
3. One or more `FilterRail` rows.
4. The list itself.

Do not place filters above quick statistics when both are present.

Every immediate step in that order uses the same `1.25rem` (`mt-5`) top gap. Measure it from the actual bottom of the preceding element: the description and primary action share one bottom line, then tabs, stats, rails, or direct content begin from that line. Do not use page-local `mt-6`, reserved description height, spacer blocks, or margins that make one tab breathe differently from its siblings.

A list tab must not insert a page-specific summary, capacity note, explanatory paragraph, owner roll-up, or other bespoke information block between these standard elements. Put stable explanatory copy in the tab description, append genuinely useful dynamic context to that description, express a compact measurement through `QuickStats`, or omit it. Transactional errors and actionable warnings use the platform's approved notice treatment and are not list summaries.

## QuickStats

`QuickStats` is the canonical compact summary strip above a list. The Polls tab is the visual reference. It communicates a small set of immediately useful counts or short measurements; it is not a filter and its boxes are not individually clickable.

```tsx
<QuickStats items={[
    { label: "Running", value: runningCount },
    { label: "History", value: pollCount },
    { label: "Source checks", value: checkCount, hideOnMobile: true },
    { label: "Raw returned", value: rawCount },
]} />
```

- Use three visible statistics on mobile. A fourth lower-priority statistic may set `hideOnMobile` and return from `sm` upward.
- Mobile renders one consolidated, bordered strip with internal dividers. Desktop separates the same statistics into evenly sized bordered boxes.
- Labels are short neutral text; values are prominent, tabular, and limited to one line.
- Prefer current list facts such as actionable count, reserved time, open failures, or poll results. Do not fill the strip with decorative totals.
- Capacity and forecast information belongs here when it can be expressed compactly, for example `Capacity — 10h late`; do not repeat it in a prose block beneath the filters.
- `QuickStats` summarizes the currently meaningful list scope. Filtering may update the values when that makes the summary more truthful.
- Use `StatusStat` for small inline status counts inside a settings or status context; use `QuickStats` for the top-of-list summary strip.

## FilterRail

`FilterRail` is the canonical list-filtering mechanic. Its appearance and behaviour come from the Relationships lifecycle rail.

```tsx
<FilterRail ariaLabel="Filter relationships by lifecycle stage">
    <FilterRailLink href={allHref} selected={!phase}>All <FilterRailCount>{allCount}</FilterRailCount></FilterRailLink>
    <FilterRailLink href={leadHref} selected={phase === "lead"}>Lead <FilterRailCount>{leadCount}</FilterRailCount></FilterRailLink>
</FilterRail>
```

- Each rail represents one filtering dimension. Use a second rail with `spacing="tight"` when a list genuinely needs another dimension, such as Maintenance state plus category.
- The selected option uses plain white text and a white underline. Unselected options remain neutral and acquire only a restrained hover underline.
- Counts sit beside labels in subdued tabular text and should reflect the other currently selected filter dimensions.
- Prefer `FilterRailLink` and URL-backed query parameters so filters survive refresh, back/forward navigation, sharing, and tab restoration.
- When the complete candidate collection is already present in the page, add `instant` to `FilterRailLink` and render records through `InstantFilterResults`. This keeps the URL authoritative while applying the visible change locally instead of rerunning the server page. Keep paginated, permission-dependent, or data-dependent filters server-backed.
- Use `FilterRailButton` only for local interactive state that cannot reasonably be URL-backed, such as the live Work Queue's Business/My work view.
- Rails never wrap. They scroll horizontally on mobile while preserving option order.
- Do not recreate filter pills, segmented boxes, dropdowns, or page-local category chips when the available choices fit a rail.
- When `QuickStats` and `FilterRail` are both present, every stats block comes first and the first rail follows beneath it.

## List

`List` is the canonical presentation for a collection of comparable records that people need to scan, open, and act on. Leads, polls, and relationships are the reference implementations. A list is not a gallery, settings form, navigation rail, timeline, disclosure log, or nested planning structure such as OKRs.

### Anatomy

Use the primitives in `components/list`:

```tsx
<List ariaLabel="Polls">
    <ListItem>
        <MobileListActionSurface actions={actions}>
            <ListPrimaryRow>
                <ListTitle href={itemHref}>Item name</ListTitle>
                {/* categorical labels */}
                <Status label="In progress" tone="yellow" className="ml-auto" />
            </ListPrimaryRow>
            <ListSecondaryRow>
                {/* flexible domain metadata */}
                <ListTrailing>
                    {/* ID, time, creator, desktop actions */}
                </ListTrailing>
            </ListSecondaryRow>
        </MobileListActionSurface>
    </ListItem>
</List>
```

- `List` owns the consolidated black surface, `rounded-2xl` outer corners, neutral border, clipping, and list semantics.
- `ListItem` owns the divider between records and the restrained hover highlight. Its divider uses `border-neutral-800`, exactly matching the outer list border. Do not wrap every item in its own floating card.
- `ListPrimaryRow` is the identity and state band. It has the subtly tinted surface and an internal `border-neutral-900` divider.
- `ListSecondaryRow` is the supporting-information band. It is always one line and never wraps.
- `ListTitle` is the primary identity, always placed first and given the flexible width. Link it whenever the record has a canonical destination. It truncates rather than displacing state or actions.
- `ListTrailing` is the stable audit/action cluster at the end of the supporting row.

### Information order

The primary row follows this order:

1. Primary item name on the left.
2. Stable categorical labels immediately after the name, such as `Test`, `Manual`, or `RelationshipStage`.
3. Exactly one operational `Status` aligned to the right. A compact companion such as poll duration may sit beside it.

The secondary row follows this order:

1. Domain-specific supporting information in descending importance.
2. Measurements, contact routes, source information, or assigned-item pills where relevant.
3. `ListTrailing`, ordered as short ID, relevant relative time, creator, then overflow actions.

The meaning of the time may vary—created, updated, or latest activity—but its position and subdued treatment do not. Use the creator tooltip to disclose whether an item was created or added and its exact timestamp.

### Content and density

- Lists are intentionally two rows. Do not flatten them into a dense one-row table at wide breakpoints.
- Keep the primary row calm. It contains identity, categorical labels, and one operational status—not general metadata.
- The secondary row is flexible rather than column-prescriptive. Omit unavailable fields cleanly; do not render empty column placeholders.
- Use `text-sm` and neutral supporting colours. Reserve `text-base font-medium` for the primary name.
- Use the shared `Status`, pill, stage, creator, and action components. Do not recreate their appearance locally.
- Use short, scannable values. Longer explanation belongs on the detail page or in an intentionally designed preview field.
- Keep one obvious primary destination and move secondary operations into `ListActionMenu`.

### Responsive behaviour

- Preserve the same two semantic rows at every breakpoint.
- Each semantic row is exactly one visual line high. Neither text nor a UI element may wrap beneath another item inside that row; a two-line primary or secondary band is not permitted.
- The title receives flexible space and truncates first. Primary labels, stages, and statuses are single-line, non-wrapping elements.
- On the secondary row, preserve the most important domain value on mobile and progressively reveal lower-priority values at `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. Do not attempt to retain every desktop field by wrapping it.
- Mobile priority is: the short ID, one useful non-sensitive core measurement where appropriate, then the relative time and creator. The short ID is always visible. Secondary descriptive metadata, locations, and assigned-item pills appear only when the available breakpoint can accommodate them on the same line.
- Relationship phone numbers, WhatsApp numbers, and email addresses are never shown in the mobile list. They return at their documented wider breakpoints and remain available as copy actions in the mobile action popup.
- Assigned services use `MobileAssignedServices` below `sm`: show the first unique service as an emerald `RoundPill`, followed by a plain `+N` count when more unique services are assigned. Never render a second service pill on the mobile row. When none are assigned, show `No assigned services` in neutral supporting text rather than leaving an unexplained gap.
- Mobile and desktop service renderers must be mutually exclusive. Put responsive `hidden`/display classes on a wrapper around desktop pills, never directly on `RoundPill`; the primitive owns `inline-flex`, so using it as the responsive switch can leak desktop pills into the mobile row and displace `ListTrailing`.
- Truncation is for flexible text values such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and locations. Fixed semantic controls—`Status`, `RelationshipStage`, pills, creator, and actions—must remain intact rather than compressing or splitting.
- When several values share a band, order them by importance so overflow removes the least important information first. Do not use horizontal scrolling to expose ordinary list metadata.
- The outer list remains one consolidated collection on mobile and desktop; do not switch between separate cards and a table at an arbitrary breakpoint.
- Mobile rows use slightly tighter vertical padding than desktop rows. Preserve the shared `py-2 sm:py-2.5` rhythm rather than overriding row height per feature.

The two divider colours are deliberately different: the darker `border-neutral-900` separates the primary and secondary bands within one record, while the stronger `border-neutral-800` separates records and matches the list perimeter. This alternating rhythm must remain visible on mobile and desktop.

### Interaction and exceptional state

- Every `ListItem` receives the shared subtle hover background so the active record is easy to track across a wide row.
- On mobile, `MobileListActionSurface` makes the entire item one accessible action target. Tapping anywhere opens the item's action popup; it does not navigate immediately. The canonical `Open …` action is first, followed by secondary and destructive actions.
- The three-dot `ListActionMenu` is hidden on mobile. From `sm` upward, the action surface disappears, the linked title is the default navigation affordance, and the three-dot menu is restored as the final element.
- List action popups use `AnchoredPopup`. They open directly above the pressed three-dot button or mobile action surface with a `6px` gap, align to its trailing edge, and stay at least `8px` inside the visible viewport. If vertical space is limited, the popup scrolls internally instead of crossing the top edge. They portal into the highest same-origin document with the platform popup stack level so list shells, sticky rows, and iframe boundaries cannot cover them.
- A popup closes after choosing an action, pressing its trigger again, clicking outside it, pressing Escape, navigating its owning frame, or switching away from its owning workspace tab. A parent-shell portal must never outlive the tab that opened it.
- Do not create page-local absolute dropdowns, below-first menus, or fixed coordinates for list actions. `AnchoredPopup` owns repositioning on scrolling, resizing, mobile visual-viewport changes, and trigger/content size changes.
- Destructive operations remain inside the action popup and keep their confirmation behaviour at every breakpoint.
- Creator avatars in lists use the stable, versioned `/api/profile-avatars/[username]` rendition rather than direct signed upload URLs. This keeps the displayed file small and cacheable across tab openings; do not restore per-render signed URLs in list implementations.
- A genuine failed or critical record may add a very faint semantic wash to `ListItem`, but this must not replace its `Status` or alter the standard geometry.

### Reference mappings

- Lead: owner and company; callability status; phone, source, industry, location, score; ID, created time, Betelgeze creator, actions.
- Poll: source summary; manual/automated label; poll status and duration; pipeline counts; ID, created time, creator, actions.
- Relationship: person and business; Test and lifecycle labels; work status; role, contact routes, location and assigned services; ID, updated time, creator, actions.
- Onboarding: person and business; Test/Stuck labels and onboarding status; step/submission/file counts and assigned services/modules; relationship ID, latest activity, creator, actions.
- Fulfilment: work-item title and operational status; attached relationship and concise work context; work-item ID, relevant time, creator, actions.
- Work Item: task title, Key task label, lifecycle stage and operational status; priority or concise description; work-item ID, relevant time, creator, actions. `components/list/work-item-presentation.ts` is the shared label/tone map for work-item statuses; list and detail views must use it together.
- Communication: person and business, channel label and latest-message status; one-line message preview and direction; relationship ID, latest-message time, actions.
- Admin Work Queue: work-item title and Admin work kind; queue priority status; concise queue rationale, effort, forecast and priority source; work-item ID, latest update, execution-owner assignee, actions.
- Maintenance: coded failure title, severity and Admin labels, work-item status; category, priority, occurrence count and first occurrence; work-item ID, latest occurrence, assignee, source and work-item actions.
- Activity: recorded event summary and category, truthful event-level status; event key, compact metadata and attached entity; event ID, occurrence time, actor or Betelgeze automation avatar, source and copy actions.

When a new list cannot fit this anatomy, first determine whether it is actually a list. Do not extend the standard merely to make galleries, timelines, settings rows, evidence disclosures, or nested planning structures resemble one.

The Assets gallery remains a gallery even though it shares the Library panel header, tabs, and `QuickStats` with Work Items. OKRs remain a nested planning workspace. Settings/source rows and onboarding-builder records remain configuration or authoring controls. None should be forced into `List` merely because they contain repeated records.

## Detail pages

A detail page is the canonical destination for one durable record. Relationship, onboarding, fulfilment, work-item, asset, poll, and activity-event detail routes share one visual sequence even though their content differs:

1. Mandatory `DetailPageHeader`.
2. Optional `DetailFields` when the record has attributes worth inspecting or editing.
3. Record-specific content such as a Gantt chart, onboarding timeline, asset preview, poll funnel, updates, or diagnostics.
4. Mandatory `DetailDangerZone` at the bottom of the primary content column for records that can participate in the shared archive lifecycle.

The record-specific middle remains flexible. The header, fields, and destructive-action anatomy do not.

### Progressive detail loading

- Start independent record queries together. Progressive rendering must not introduce an artificial header-then-fields-then-content request waterfall.
- During route navigation, retain a known record identity in `DetailPageHeader` when available and place `DetailFieldsLoading` directly beneath it. If no identity is known yet, show the compact opening label rather than a full-page generic skeleton.
- In the resolved route, keep the real `DetailPageHeader` outside the data boundaries. Give `DetailFields` the first meaningful `Suspense` boundary, followed by a separate boundary for record-specific content.
- Use `DetailContentLoading` for a heavier section such as a Gantt or onboarding timeline. The fallback identifies the pending section and reserves a modest amount of space; it must not imitate the entire final page or pulse every row.
- Each boundary reveals once. Do not replace already-resolved fields with a second intermediate state, and do not refetch shared data for a later boundary; create and share one promise instead.
- Keep `DetailDangerZone` last. A static danger zone does not need an artificial delay merely to make it appear later, but it must never block the header or fields from streaming.

### DetailPageHeader

```tsx
<DetailPageHeader
    category="Relationship"
    reference={shortId(relationship.id)}
    title={relationship.primary_person_name}
    subtitle={relationship.business_name ?? "No company saved"}
    labels={<SquarePill tone="yellow">Test</SquarePill>}
    facts={[{ label: "assets", value: 4 }]}
    updated="5hr"
/>
```

- The first line always identifies the record category and short ID in subdued monospaced text: `Relationship 69e381e`, `Poll e154d7a`, or `Asset c92f810`.
- String record names also supply the automatic workspace tab label. Relationship and work-item tabs use the name; onboarding, fulfilment, and appointment-setting details append their section. Communications tabs use `Chat · Name` for the active client, direct, or team chat, and `Communications` when none is selected. Explicit custom tab names take precedence.
- The record name is always `text-2xl`, semibold, and tightly tracked. Do not use a different title scale for a more complicated page.
- An optional subtitle gives one stable secondary identity, such as company, event key, or source context. It is not a description of the whole panel.
- The right-hand metadata rail is bottom-aligned with the identity block. Its order is key categorical labels, up to two short numerical facts, then `Updated …` as the final item.
- Header labels are reserved for meaningful classification or exception labels such as `Test`, `Stuck`, an asset kind, a manual poll, or a relationship lifecycle stage when that stage is not already obvious from the page. Use the shared `SquarePill` or `RelationshipStage`; do not hand-build a badge.
- Operational `Status` never appears in `DetailPageHeader`. It belongs in one `DetailField`, which is the page's canonical overall-status location. Do not repeat that same overall status in a content-block heading.
- Facts are optional, limited to two, and read value first (`2 assets`, `1m 42s duration`). Prefer facts that are not stated again below. If no unrepeated metric is useful, show only labels and `Updated …` rather than filling the rail for symmetry.
- Do not promote field values such as progress, trigger, source, or status into the header merely because there is room.
- On narrow screens the metadata rail moves below the identity, wraps between whole elements, and never splits a pill or status.
- The header owns its `border-neutral-800`, `pb-4`, and internal `gap-3`. A page must not wrap it in a second card, add another record title, or override its typography and spacing.

`DetailPageHeader` is distinct from `PanelTabHeader`: a panel-tab header names a workspace view or collection, while a detail header identifies one record. A detail route nested under a panel may retain the panel's shared tab navigation above it, but must not use a second panel heading as the record header.

### DetailFields

```tsx
<DetailFields>
    <DetailField label="Status" icon="status">
        <Status label="To do" tone="grey" />
    </DetailField>
    <DetailField label="Assigned to" icon="user" className="lg:border-l lg:pl-8">
        <Assignee name="Alex Morgan" avatarSrc={avatarUrl} />
    </DetailField>
</DetailFields>
```

- The fields block has the same background as the page and no outer border, rounded card, heading, or inset panel.
- It starts exactly `1.25rem` (`mt-5`) below the header and uses one column on mobile and two columns from `lg` upward.
- Every `DetailField` is a restrained row with a muted icon and label, a readable value, `min-h-10`, `py-2`, and a `border-neutral-900` bottom divider.
- Desktop rows use a fixed `9rem` label track; mobile uses `8rem`. Values take the remaining width and may contain text, inputs, selectors, shared pills, `Status`, `Assignee`, or a popup trigger.
- The second desktop column adds `border-l border-neutral-900 pl-8`. A full-width field uses `lg:col-span-2`. The page supplies only these placement classes; it must not restyle the row.
- Editable values remain visually quiet on the page surface. Popups may use their own bordered floating surface. Use established shared primitives inside values instead of local imitations.
- Every field popup uses `AnchoredPopup`, anchored to the exact pressed field value. It opens directly above that trigger, is clamped within the visible viewport, scrolls internally when space is constrained, and portals in front of page, shell, and same-origin iframe content. This placement is recalculated while the page, visual viewport, trigger, or popup changes size or position.
- Omit fields that do not apply. Do not render decorative empty rows to balance the columns.
- Long descriptions may span both columns. Record-specific analytical summaries such as poll funnel statistics remain content, not fields.

### Record-specific content

- Unique content follows the fields block at the normal `mt-5` or `mt-6` page rhythm and may use the surface best suited to its interaction.
- A relationship Gantt, onboarding timeline, asset preview, poll funnel, or diagnostic payload is allowed to retain its own internal design because it is not interchangeable record metadata.
- Do not repeat the record name, category, ID, overall status, or general details heading inside this content.

### DetailDangerZone

```tsx
<DetailDangerZone>
    <DetailDangerAction
        title="Archive relationship"
        description="Removes it from active lists while preserving its history."
        control={<DetailDangerButton>Archive relationship</DetailDangerButton>}
    />
    <DetailDangerAction
        title="Delete relationship permanently"
        description="This cannot be undone."
        control={<DetailDangerButton tone="delete">Delete permanently</DetailDangerButton>}
    />
</DetailDangerZone>
```

- The danger zone is the final block in the primary content column. Nothing ordinary follows it.
- It is one restrained red-tinted box: a low-opacity red-black background, muted red border, rounded corners, and small red heading. The treatment must read as a warning without becoming the visually loudest block on the page.
- Actions are vertically divided by subdued dark-red rules. Each row presents a title and concise consequence on the left and one fixed control on the right; controls stack below the explanation on mobile.
- Archive is always first and uses the quieter red-outline button. It removes a record from active views while preserving history and dependencies.
- Permanent deletion is always last and uses a slightly stronger dark-red filled button, never a bright solid red. Its wording must be explicit, and its confirmation must identify irreversible consequences and dependent records.
- Other destructive lifecycle actions, such as restarting onboarding, may sit between Archive and Delete and use the outline treatment.
- During the visual-definition phase, unavailable archive/delete actions remain visibly disabled with an honest explanation. Do not connect a destructive control to an unrelated mutation or imply that a placeholder works.
- Owner/admin visibility, confirmation, server authorization, archive persistence, restoration, and dependency-aware permanent deletion are functional requirements. The shared visual primitive does not replace them.
- Records that are deliberately immutable for audit or compliance may disable both controls pending a documented retention decision; they must not silently invent different danger-zone styling.

When the archive lifecycle is implemented, active lists exclude archived records by default and the proposed Library `Archived` tab becomes the shared restoration and permanent-deletion surface. That future behaviour must reuse the same archive terminology and must not change this visual contract without updating the components and this document together.

## TrendChart

`TrendChart` is the canonical compact time-series graph. It owns the chart geometry, white trend line, fading area gradient, axes, emphasized reference ticks, optional red exception bands, responsive labels, and keyboard/pointer tooltip behaviour. Feature code supplies normalized positions, numeric values, and already-formatted labels; it must not recreate the SVG treatment locally.

Use the neutral white line for ordinary measurements and activity volume. Use `tone="red"` only when the series itself measures errors or critical failures; it changes both the line and its gradient. Red bands mark exceptional or missed periods behind another series and do not change the meaning of the measured line itself.

```tsx
<TrendChart
    ariaLabel="Messages sent over the last 30 days"
    points={points}
    startPoint={{ position: 0, value: previousValue }}
    domainEnd={30}
    min={0}
    max={100}
/>
```

Pass `reveal` to animate the trend line and gradient together from left to right on mount. Key the chart by the selected period to replay this on range changes. Axes remain steady; reduced-motion preferences disable the animation.

Use `breakBefore` on a trend point when missing observations should interrupt the line and area. Do not turn periods with no denominator into a zero error rate.

## Workspace tab gestures

Mobile tab swipes scroll the strip. A stationary 650ms press lifts a tab for reordering; movement before the hold completes cancels drag activation. Desktop reordering starts after a short horizontal drag. Both use the same lifted preview outside the strip's clipping area, with a 140ms upward lift and subtle scale. Reduced motion uses an immediate offset. Drop and cancellation remove the preview immediately; taps, tab closing, and renaming retain their existing behavior.
